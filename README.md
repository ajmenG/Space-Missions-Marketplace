## 🌌 Concept & Vision

Imagine a world where every space enthusiast, engineer, scientist, or medical specialist can:

1. **Showcase Credentials:** Upload and verify certificates, qualifications, and mission-specific training.
2. **Discover Missions:** Browse upcoming space expeditions, research projects, and commercial flights.
3. **Express Interest:** Signal participation intent, rank preferences, and negotiate participation terms.

At the same time, mission organizers gain access to:

* **Interest Dashboard:** Real-time insights into candidate numbers, role demands, and mission popularity.
* **Qualification Matrix:** View applicants’ certificates and skill sets to match ideal crew compositions.
* **Communication Tools:** Reach out to candidates for interviews, training sessions, or contractual negotiations.

This symbiotic ecosystem aims to accelerate crew selection, foster transparent communication, and democratize access to space.

* **Hypermatching Engine:** Utilizing candidate certificates, past mission experience, and skill profiles, an intelligent matching algorithm recommends the most suitable missions for each user, optimizing crew composition and participation chances.
